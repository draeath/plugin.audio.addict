# FAQ
**Is an account needed?**

Yes! The current version of this addon doesn't allow the usage without a valid account. Whereas it is possible to listen to AudioAddict radio streams without an account for 30 minutes, the full listening experience only gets unveiled with an account to listen to any radio stream for an unlimited amount of time.

**Do I need a premium account?**

No! But if you want to listen to the streams without any interruption by commercials and with higher audio quality you should consider purchasing a premium account.

**Where to register and get a premium account?**

You can do this at any of the networks web sites. Your account will be valid for all networks.
